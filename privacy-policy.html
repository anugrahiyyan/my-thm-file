            <p>At ONEderland Enterprise, we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of all data stored within our systems.

                    <li><strong>Secure Access:</strong> Access to our system is protected by multi-factor authentication (MFA), strong password policies, and role-based permissions to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Server Security:</strong> Our server is regularly updated with the latest security patches and monitored to detect any potential vulnerabilities. Firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and secure SSH access are in place to further enhance security.</li>
